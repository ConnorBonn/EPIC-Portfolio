## About Me
* I am currently a Sophomore at Heritage High School and Epic Campus.  I have always been interested in math and used
* to compete in any of the completions I could when I was younger.  I play volleyball for Heritage High School and I'm 
* currently in the process of trying out for Front Range Volleyball Club (FRVC).  
* My favorite sport to watch is basketball wiht my favorite team being the Boston Celtics.
* My top 2 subjects to learn in or outside of school are math or more specically algebra and history.  Math is a enjoyable 
* because its a puzzle.  Theres clear patterns and if you can figure out how it works its easy to find the answer.  Histoy
* is enjoyable because of how it connects things.  Being able to connect things to each other like how the great depression 
* connects to WW2 is really interesting.
### Strengths
- I move around a lot and like to do multiple things at one time so taking on more resposiblity is something I enjoy ocasionally doing
- I'm willing and able to do a wide variety of things meaning I can apply myself in different areas incase I need to
- I enjoy working with others and I can talk to people and get along with them pretty easily

### Goals
- My main goal is just finding out what I want to focus on.  I can do software and learn it but I have trouble sitting still
- doing basically nothing for a long period of time so switching to something where I can move around could be more advantageous.
- Outside of school/work my main goals are just training for volleyball and getting my drivers license.

## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* In this class I learned what different types of data structures were and how they are used.  The main ones we learn
* are stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, and sorting algorithms.  Apart from learn different data structures we
* also were taught things about how to be more professional and workforce ready.  Every week we had questions to answer
* and had to set goals for ourselves.  We practiced interview questions with other classes and people in order to learn
* how to answer questions more clearly and professionally.

### Capstone
* In Capstone we worked on more large projects.  We took skills learned from the previous semester and learned some new skill
* and then applied them to some newer projects.  For example one of our first projects was extracting the meta data from an image.
* this project was longer than any other we had previously done and used multiple of skills we had learned previously.  We also 
* worked in teams to created a web application to play sounds where you could upload your own sounds and such.  This project included
* several new skills but also a lot of what we had learned previously.

### Workforce Readiness
- During our Epic courses aside from learning coding and how to use different applicaitons such as AWS and SQL we also learned how to be
- prepared for the workforce.  Every so often we would have courses and lectures about different large topics such as interveiws and how 
- the industry worked/looked.  We went on tours to worksites to learn how they function and worked on skills while what most people would
- consider computer science was nesecary to software engineering as a profession.  This included taking a course on technical writing, learning
- how to properly write comments and commit messages, and how to work with a team and work based on a designated role.

### Professional Experiences
- SC23 Conference

## Projects: 
-  Binary Search Trees - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/binary-search-trees-2-ConnorBonn.git
	- This project was about a type of data structure where numbers or letters are put into what looks like a tree.
    - Making the tree helps with several things.  Nodes which are used in the tree are used for multiple different data
    - structures.  
	- Doing this project I learned to better understand loops and calling different methods.  It also taught me how
    - to use recursion and the advantages of it.
- Reverse Polish Notation - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/reverse-polish-notation-henryk-zygalski.git
	 - This project was about transcribing normal math notation into postfix and prefix notation.  We had to take a 
     - equation and translate it into postfix and then solve it.  We also had to be able to translate a postfix 
     - expression back into normal math notation.
	- The project we did before this was making stacks and queues but this showed more how they can actually be used.  
    - You can push the numbers into a stack and then pop them out in the order you need or use a queue to store numbers
    - or operators.
