## About Me
* I am currently a Sophomore at Heritage High School and Epic Campus.  I have always been interested in math and used
* to compete in any of the completions I could when I was younger.  I play volleyball recreational and play some
* basketball.
* I love learning about history.  Ever since my 8th grade teach Mr Mathay really got me into history I've always wanted
* to learn more.  History is the best way to understand current and future events.  I also enjoy learning math.  I've
* always been good at learning patterns and rules and that's all math is I think its fun.  Other than that things like 
* puzzles and games are what I spend more my time doing.
### Strengths
- I enjoy working on the coding projects that we have done and learning the different kinds of things I can do is 
- interesting.  I am always willing to learn if I'm stuck on something and I have no issue spending extra time on 
- projects.
### Goals
- Right now I want to get better at specifically recursion, but I also want to learn how to make more things.  As of
- right now we have only really made different data structures but making something that can actually be used for
- something is one of my main goals.

## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* In this class I learned what different types of data structures were and how they are used.  The main ones we learn
* are stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, and sorting algorithms.  Apart from learn different data structures we
* also were taught things about how to be more professional and workforce ready.  Every week we had questions to answer
* and had to set goals for ourselves.  We practiced interview questions with other classes and people in order to learn
* how to answer questions more clearly and professionally.

### Workforce Readiness
- Every week we did workforce readiness.  This forced us to work on things that we weren't good at.  I've never been
- good at working with people, it was one of my main goals. I was pushed to learn to work with people on a project
- together or just on separate things.

### Professional Experiences
- SC23 Conference

## Projects: 
-  Binary Search Trees - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/binary-search-trees-2-ConnorBonn.git
	- This project was about a type of data structure where numbers or letters are put into what looks like a tree.
    - Making the tree helps with several things.  Nodes which are used in the tree are used for multiple different data
    - structures.  
	- Doing this project I learned to better understand loops and calling different methods.  It also taught me how
    - to use recursion and the advantages of it.
- Reverse Polish Notation - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/reverse-polish-notation-henryk-zygalski.git
	 - This project was about transcribing normal math notation into postfix and prefix notation.  We had to take a 
     - equation and translate it into postfix and then solve it.  We also had to be able to translate a postfix 
     - expression back into normal math notation.
	- The project we did before this was making stacks and queues but this showed more how they can actually be used.  
    - You can push the numbers into a stack and then pop them out in the order you need or use a queue to store numbers
    - or operators.
